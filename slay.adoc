== Introduction

This is the Player's Guide for the Hack and Slay gaming system. Hack and
Slay is a Role-Playing Game system developed by Josef Frisch and with
additions and modifications from other GMs and players using the system over
many years.

== General Skill Rules

The GM's Decision is final, and takes precedence over anything written
in these rules.

You roll 3d6 + (Skill Plus).

Your opponent or the universe rolls 3d6 + (Plus).

You must equal your opponent's roll to succeed.

Multiple spells per round: If not otherwise specified, with 2 skills, both
are at -2, with 3 at -4, with 4 at -6, etc.

In these rules, 3d6 refers to extended 3d6, where on an 18, MAX(3d6-10,0) is
added, and on a 3, MIN(3d6-10,0) is added. These rolls are iterated for
multiple 3s or 18s.

For skill rolls for unspecified skills, roll at the listed stat plus.

Scale: 1 round is 2 seconds, 1 hex is 5 feet

Characters are generated by the Slay program. Very roughly, you get +1 for
about 500 EP, additional +1 for each X2 in EP.

Skills are listed along with the amount of training (1 EP (experience point)
= 1 hour of training or experience) and the resulting plus. Pluses are
calculated by the Slay program and are based on skills and stats. Note that
there are interactions between skills, so that training in one skill can
improve others. Training in skills affects stats - usually, but not always
resulting in an increase.

=== Order of Actions

  * Reserved actions can occur at any time during a round
  * Movement, which includes Engage rolls
  * Hand to hand combat
  * Missile weapons
  * Magic spell casting: all spells declared
  * Magic spell normal counters: all counters declared
  * Brute force counters
  * Psi
  * Other actions (``special actions'')
  ** Military Command to determine enemy combat pluses
  ** Soliloquy phase
  **

=== Experience Points

An EP represents 1 hour of training in a skill. Skills where you have less
than base EP are shown without a vertical bar after the skill on the
character sheet. Skills with very low Pluses (less than a large negative
value) are not shown on the character sheet as they are likely to always
fail when used.

Characters start with relatively low EP and the amount increases after each
run depending on what happened.

[NOTE]
====
In principle, you must apply the EP for the time you have spent performing
some skill. For example, if you are working harvesting crops for a week, you
must put 40 EP / week into farming.

In practice, this turns out to be a bookkeeping nightmare resulting in
characters having extremely high EP in Travelling (which is not an actual
skill) and not much else. Instead, the GM usually awards a fixed number of
EP for each run of a campaign, and players are expected to allocate them
reasonably based on what they did in the run. Sometimes there will be
directives given by the GM which *must* be followed, e.g. "1000 EP of which
200 must be in Sailing."
====

=== Combining Skills

==== Adding Pluses

Several characters can combine their skills in working on a problem (where
it makes sense as decided by the game master). The ``value'' of a skill is
2^plus^. Add all of the skill values, take the log~2~ of that value, and
round down. Example: 3 magicians are working on a combined spell. They have
pluses of 5,4,3. The values are 32,16,8. The sum is 56 which is between 2^5^
and 2^6^ so the net plus is still 5. If the magicians had pluses of 4,4,4,
the sum is 48, which gives a net plus of 5.

For some skills, like stealth, more people decrease the effectiveness. In
that case, add the inverses. In that case, 5,4,3 would add to 3 (round up).
4,4,4 would add to 3.

[NOTE]
====
A simpler way is to sum lower-valued Pluses: "Two +2s is a +3. Is there a
+3? Yes, so two +3s is a +4." Likewise 3 +2s is a +3, 4 +2s is a +4.

The player with the highest Plus normally rolls the dice with the group
Plus.

Players are not likely to all think of doing the same thing at the same
time. Players are not required to accept other players' help when using
skills, no matter how much sense that makes to the other players.

Usually the GM will allow only one roll for the group to be made for the
party in a specific situation, such as rolling Alertness to detect an
ambush.

In certain circumstances, such as Scrounging for unique items or Shopping in
a bazzar, each player will be allowed a separate roll with separate results.
====

==== Multiplying damages

Various items and spells increase damages in combat. If the use of two
devices gives XN and XM damage, the resulting damage is X(N+M).

=== Character Sheets

Character abilities are based on _stats_, which are intrinsic properties of
the character. Stats can range from 3-18, and in rare circumstances, higher.
The Slay program starts with each stat set to a default value for the
character's chosen race. They may be changed at will during character
creation, but not afterwards.

In rare cases, the GM may impose or allow stat modifications after the
campaign begins, through rare, dangerous, and/or expensive means such as
Chaos Spells, Stat Potions, Polymorph Potions.

[NOTE]
====
Stats affect how easily you gain pluses in skills. Each skill has a weighted
contribution from the stats which affect it; this can be seen in the GUI for
the Slay program (or extracted from the +skill.dbs+ file, if you're that
dedicated).

There are a fixed number of _stat points_ available to starting characters,
and the program rebalances the output stat values to match the available
stat points. The cost of increased stat points is nonlinear, so it's much
more expensive to raise a stat from 17 to 18 than it is to raise it from 10 to
11.

The number of stat points rarely increases, unlike EP. It's usually best to
pick one or two stats relative to your character's role and make them as
large as possible, in the 16-18 range; for example, mages might choose MAG 18
and INT 16, heavy weapon fighters STR 18 and CON 16, rogues AGI and DEX 17,
etc. Other stats which are significant can be raised to the 13-15 range, and
the rest left near the defaults for the character race.

This is general advice, not a rule. Hyperoptimization of your character is
possible, but not in the spirit of the system. The Slay algorithms are very
nonlinear and very poorly documented. Rather than write optimization
software, make some reasonable guesses, iterate a bit, and then play the
character you have.

|====

=== Character Races

Most characters are human. Different races (Human, Elf, Orc, etc.) may
sometimes be chosen for a character. Races usually differ in important ways
both in terms of their default stats - Elves are more attractive, Orcs are
stronger, Dwarves are tougher, etc. - and in how they are played.

Races are built into the Slay program's database, and may be selected at
character creation time. In some campaigns, an alternate method of selecting
races by manually modifying the stats may be allowed; see the
<<experimental-races,Experimental Character Races>> section.

=== Special stat rules

*Money* gives the character starting wealth in gold = 2^(MON-10)^. The
character must spend this much each year on luxuries to maintain their
social standing. If they spend less than this in a year, the social status
drops by as much as 3 (down to the level set by the amount spent). If you
spend more than this in a year, you can move up 1 status level (max) by
spending 2X the amount required for the next level. Valid luxuries include
housing, food, clothes, parties, etc. Invalid are weapons, training, and
investments.

.Money and Social Class
[options="header"]
|====
| Money | Social Class
| <3    | Escaped slave, escaped criminal, a hunted man
| 3     | Slave
| 4     | Villain, Indentured servant
| 5     | Low servant (cleaning staff, etc), or laborer
| 6     | Generic servant
| 7-8   | Generic worker, guard
| 9-11  | Craftsman, farmer, poor merchant, etc. Soldier
| 12-14 | Wealthy craftsman or merchant, Low ranking officer

| 17    | Noble - Duke, General, Fabulously wealthy merchant
| 18    | Prince.
| 19    | Crown Prince
| 20    | King
|====

*Senses*: The Senses Plus is rolled to observe things that have already been
noticed by the character. The _Alertness_ skill is used when the character
needs to notice something.

=== Weapons

Each character has several standard sets of equipment. All combat pluses are
calculated for each set of equipment (e.g. sword and shield). Equipment may
affect other abilities, as listed in the skill description. Carrying or
using various weapons will reduce other skills. A typical list is give
below; however, it is up to the GM to make the decision in each case. For
multiple items carried, use the skill ``subtraction'' rules.

For the purposes of this discussion:

  * Small weapons: Dagger, nunchucks.
  * One hand weapons: sword, mace, short bow (carried).
  * Weapon and shield: any weapon used with a shield
  * Two hand weapons: two hand sword, long bow (carried), any bow used,
    staff.

[1] Reduce area effect damage by this amount: see notes in combat section

[2] No acrobatics or stealth minus for Light 2-hand Sword. No swimming minus
for staff.

[3] 2X normal price

=== Aging Rules

These rules are optional and rarely used.

Typical character starting age is 15 + EP/300. For characters entering in
the midst of a campaign, the GM should produce a set of rules.

[NOTE]
====
Most campaigns now start new characters with the same number of EP as
existing characters, to avoid disgruntlement and the desire to keep the
eldest character alive at all costs, so new characters get the most EP
possible.

In the past, it was typical to give a new character the base EP the campaign
started with plus half of the difference between that and the maximum EP of
any player, and add the length of the campaign to the character's age.
====

After a character is generated, the *Stat EP* field in the Slay program
should be set to 0, which prevents stat rebalancing. Then the following
modifications are made to the character's stats. Note that these charts are
not exact for extreme ages, and should only be used as guidelines outside
the 15-75 age range.

.Aging Modifiers On Stats

=== Hunger and Thirst

Lack of food and water will have both short and long term effects. Base
effects on the most limited of food or water. Both affect all skills. For
each time, make a roll at con+. Failure means you take the minus, otherwise
roll again after another time period.

.Hunger and Thirst Modifiers
[options="header"]
|====
| Condition                  | Skill Modifiers
| No Water (1)               | -1 every 12 hours
| No Food                    | -1 every 2 days
| Limited food               | Take minus at 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, 10 years
| Recovery from limited food | +1 at 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month.
|====

[1] Effects of no water at normal temperatures. Otherwise, see the Outdoor
Survival tables.

== Combat

*Reserved Actions:* An action that is ready to be performed may be
``reserved'' until a later round. A character may not take any other action
(anything requiring a roll, or a move above 2 hexes / round) while holding a
reserved action.

*Simultaneity:* Combat is assumed to be simultaneous unless otherwise noted
(see dropping pluses to attack first). If there is a simultaneous kill, roll
a d6. On a 1 or 2, Combatant #1 is killed and #2 is unhurt. On a 3 or 4,
both are killed. On a 5 or 6, Combatant #2 is killed and #1 is unhurt.

=== Hit Points

Hit Points (HP) are the damage you can take before your actions become
impaired due to damage. Effects of negative HP are listed below. Note: C* =
CON^2^ / 10

.Hit Points, Combat Modifiers, and Recovery Rates
[options="header"]
|====
| HP             | Effect                        | Recovery
| HP to HP/2     | None                          | C*/10 / hour
| HP/2 - 1 to 0  | None                          | C*/10 / day
| -1 to -C*/2    | -1 combat for each 10% of C*  | C*/10 / week
| -C*/2-1 to -C* | -1 move for each 20%C*        | C*/10 / week
| -C*-1 to -2*C* | Unconscious                   | C*/10 / week
| < -2*C*        | *Dead* - no recovery possible | n/a
|====

Recovery: After 3 rounds of no combat actions, you recover d6 HP. Note that
you may not recover more points than you lost in the battle. Each hour, day
or week (depending on your position on the chart) a healer may make a
healing roll. The number of points you regain is multiplied by (1+ the
amount by which the healer makes their roll).

Orc Recovery Rates:

  * above 0: C*/10/hour
  * 0 to dead: C*/10/day.

=== Hand to Hand Weapon Combat

==== Engaging

When there is disagreement about who should be fighting who, the characters
roll 3d6 + Engage plus to see who wins. On a tie, the situation remains
unchanged. In general, if two combatants are not engaged, they must not be
in adjacent hexes. Note: combat actions may change the engagement plus.
Engagement must be handled by the GM on a case by case basis.

[NOTE]
====
Good rules for resolving engage conflicts would be very useful in mass
combat.
====

==== Attack Mode

The attacker chooses which defense to attack against. You may attack against
low, medium, or high armor class.

  * *Low:* Attempt to smash through defenders parry and armor. Subtract
    parry and armor from attack damage
  * *Medium:* Attempt to bash through defenders armor. Subtract armor from
    attack damage
  * *High:* Attempt to avoid parry and armor. No damage subtracted.

Dropping pluses to attack first: Weapons normally attack simultaneously. You
may drop pluses to attack first. If both combatants drop the same number of
pluses, the attacks are again simultaneous. Dropping pluses only effects the
order in which attacks occur within a phase of combat, it will not for
example allow missile combat to occur before hand to hand combat.

==== Multiple Opponents

If you are fighting more than one opponent, you defend against 2 at -2, 3 or
more at -4. Note: your DCV is never worse than -4 absolute when in combat.
Missile attacks are not included in multiple attacks.

==== Grappling and Holding

Bare hand and some creatures or weapons have the ability to use grappling
attacks. The procedure is as follows:

If both opponents want to grapple, skip to grappling. If not, the one who
wants to grapple must start the round already engaged. Grappling attacks
must be announced at the beginning of combat, and will take place after hand
to hand combat. The grappler must use their barehanded (or Karate) combat
stats for defense the round in which they are grappling.. The grappler must
then roll an attack at barehanded plus against the defender's low DCV. If it
succeeds, no damage is done, but proceed to Grappling (below). Otherwise the
round ends. Note: it is often effective for the defender to move pluses to
attack, and kill the grappler before the grappling occurs

Grappling: When grappling has started, each rolls with their grapple skill
plus at the start of each combat round. Keep track of the running total (the
amount by which one or the other player is ``Grappled''). The current winner
can end the grapple at any time and switch to normal weapons attacks.

  * Grappled < 5: either opponent can decide to break the grapple and return
    to normal combat the next round.
  * Grappled at 5-20: Only the opponent currently ahead can break the
    grapple.
  * Grappled at 20 or more: The loser takes a point of damage for each
    cumulative grapple point over 20.

Net: Special weapon. A hit against low counts as a grapple attack at +10 for
the first attack, then the net "grapples" at +0. Can be used with a 1-hand
weapon, on the net round, defend with "Net" weapon defense levels, then
attack. Can be readied overhead (spun) for an initial attack at +15 first
round.

=== Ranged Weapon Combat

==== General Rules

Pluses: Attacker uses their attack plus against opponent's defense plus -
range modifier. You take 1 range minus for each multiple of the weapon range
distance (round down: if the weapon has range 3, you are at 0 for 3 and less
hexes, -1 for 4 to 6 hexes). Note: The attacker may not shift pluses from
offense to defense.

Surprise attack: If the opponent is not aware they are being attacked and is
not in combat, their DCV is given in the combat actions list (later).

Aiming: This may only be used against a target that is not moving, or is
walking slowly. Attacker gains +1 for each round spent aiming. During
aiming, DCV is as for all out offensive. Aimed weapons attack first in
combat. Maximum aiming = +5.

Hitting a Hex: The DCV of a hex is -10.

Multiple missile attacks: Normally multiple attacks are rolled separately.
In order to save time with many attacks, the GM may use the following, only
making a single roll. The defender is at -1 for each factor of 2 in multiple
attacks. For 8 attacks, the defender is at -3. Against 200 archers on the
walls, the defender is at -7.

Reduced mobility: A defender whose mobility is limited is at worse minuses
against attacks. A defender who cannot possibly move out of an area which
will be covered with missiles, will be attacked at no worse than +0 net by
the number of missiles which hit the hex. This only applies for
*synchronized* and *planned* attacks.

Auto fire: If you fire multiple shots at a single target, the first shot
hits normally, the next 2 at -1, the next 4 at -2, etc. Subtract armor from
each projectile.

Defense: For targets without a shield: Medium DCV is equal to Low DCV. High
DCV is equal to low DCV + armor plus. Note: "armor plus" is the difference
between High DCV and Medium DCV. A shield may only be used to parry missile
attack from one hex side per round and will increase your medium DCV by 2.

Running throw: Spears and axes may be thrown from a running start. Gain
charge damage bonus, and +1 range for each hex moved, but run must be
declared in movement round, and DCV is -2.

[NOTE]
====
  * Missile weapons do not count as additional attacks for hand-to-hand
    combat, nor do hand-to-hand attacks count as multiple attacks for
    missile combat.
  * Maximum Packing of archers: For standard bowmen, 2 / hex can be packed
    if they are not attempting to defend, otherwise 1 / hex.
====

==== Cover

Protective walls, etc provides cover. It is possible to shoot through cover
using the Damage to Physical Objects rules below.

.Taking Cover
[options="header"]
|====
| Cover type | Comments                 | Attack | Defense
| None       |                          | 0      | 0
| Wall edge  |                          | -n     | +2n
| Prone      | Movement = 1 / round     | 0      | +2
| Arrow slit | Can use like a wall edge | -1     | +5
|====

==== Explosion damage

Weapon does listed number of dice in the mega hex hit. See chart for range
effects. Damage if the explosive actually hits a target is the calculated at
base explosion damage * number over, for instance if you actually hit
someone with a meteor.

.Explosion Damage
[options="header"]
|====
| Distance from center | Explosion damage divider
| Center Hex           | full
| 1 hex                | full
| 2-3 hexes            | 1/2
| 4-5 hexes            | 1/3
| 6-7 hexes            | 1/5
| 8-10 hexes           | 1/8
| >10 hexes            | 10 / hexes^2^, eg. at 30 hexes, do 1 / 90 damage.
|====

Shielding: Hexes that are in line of sight of the explosion take full
damage. If the blast must make a turn to hit the target, damage is reduced
by x2 for each turn required. A wall counts as 1 turn normally, 2 turns if
you are hiding (no shots that round). Arrow or gun slit counts as -5 dice
damage.

Armor: Armor protects against explosion damage in the same fashion it
protects against area effect damage.

=== Damage to Physical Objects

Note that the physical damage rules are complex in order to prevent
absurdities like hacking through a stone wall with a fencing foil, or even
with a sword. Damage required to destroy physical objects has been greatly
increased.

A table of the damage resistance of common objects is given below. Physical
objects are attacked normally. You may go fully offensive, or charge attack
a physical object. Some special rules apply to damaging physical objects:

A hex sized or larger physical object defends at DCV -10.

==== Attacking Through Objects

A shot with a bow or gun through a solid wall will have its base damage
reduced by 1/10 the defense of the object.

An attack through an object with a normal weapon will have its base damage
reduced by 1/4 the defense of the object.

==== Weapon Types

The effect of various weapons types depends on the target material. Note
that the base weapon damage must be taken into account when evaluating the
damage. e.g. Bare hand weapons have advantages against soft targets, however
they typically do much less damage than swords and axes. Note you can NOT
shift pluses when attacking a solid object.

  * Blunt / soft: Barehanded, club, staff, etc. These weapons are effective
    against soft targets.
  * Edged: Swords, Daggers, and spears. These weapons rely on sharp edges or
    points to do damage. They are effective against soft targets, but
    ineffective against hard targets.
  * Edged / impact: Axes, These weapons are intermediate between edged
    weapons and hard impact weapons
  * Hard impact: Hammers, Maces: These weapons rely on an impact by a hard
    object. They are effective against hard targets.
  * Concentrated impact: Pick Axe: These weapons are especially effective
    against hart brittle targets.
  * Impaling: Spears, arrows, bullets, etc

==== Types of Materials

  * Hard: Stone, ceramic, brick, etc. These materials are primarily damaged
    by concentrated shock.
  * Metal: Ductile materials, generally immune to fracture
  * Soft: Wood, plastic, organic materials. Can be fractured, or cut.

=== Other Combat

==== Mounted Combat.

At the beginning of each round of mounted combat, you must make a riding
roll with the horse temper plus + 5. If you fail the roll, you lose control
of the horse and it will shy away from combat. If you lose control of your
horse, you must make a riding roll to stay on (again with the temper plus).

Horses can be used for charge attacks with damage increases for up to
movement 10.

You may attack an opponent's horse. The opponent gets to parry for the horse
(count attacks against the horse in addition to attacks against the rider).
See stats on horses for HP and defense (if not being parried by rider).

Horses give +50% damage (or charge bonus) to hand-to-hand weapons.

"Plus" and "minus" horses are available. The plus applies to:

  * Riding roll
  * Engage plus
  * The Horse's combat pluses
  * Movement (for long races)
  * Appearance.

A general purpose horse is -1, and costs 1 GP.

A "war horse" is +0 and costs 10 GP

Then there are various more spectacular horses for 10X cost for each +1.

For Animal Training, a horse starts at -1. A successful Animal Training
roll, and 1 year will make it +0. A successful roll at -5 and 1 year will
make it +1. If the roll beats the universe by +10, then the horse is +2.

==== Combat in water

Character must make a swimming roll each round or loose 1hp from water
inhalation. All attacks are at -4 for swinging weapons, -2 for stabbing
weapons. (it is difficult to move weapons in water). Low DCV is reduced by
5. Parry DCV is reduced by the same amount as weapon skills.

==== Flying Combat

Simplified rules: Each combatant rolls their flying plus (usually flying
Dizbusters). The winner gets to attack (no shifting combat pluses for either
combatant).

A flying attacker may disengage at will from all opponents on the ground.
Otherwise it engages normally. Note that flying creatures typically have
good Engage pluses.

==== Grabbing Weapons

It is possible (but difficult) to grab an opponent's weapon in combat. You
must: be engaged, make a normal bare hand attack against high (which goes
after your opponent's attack), and then win a strength roll. If the strength
roll fails you need to try again next round.

Grabbing a sheathed weapon only requires a barehanded attack against high.

==== Area effect Damage

Applies to damage from fireballs, fire, or other area attacks. Take the
damage done, A shield (if any) will stop 50% of the damage (up to the shield
parry). Then the armor will stop an amount (usually 80%) of the remaining
damage, up to the armor defense. The remainder is done as damage.

==== Light / Darkness Rules.

Darkness affects pluses to attack and defense. In also affects some other
physical skills including acrobatics, at the GM discretion. Note that your
DCV in combat is never worse than -4 absolute. You may add your "Combat
Darkness" skill to reduce the size of these negative pluses (but not
increase them above their daylight values). These pluses apply to offense
and defense. Note: flash powder is assumed only effective in darkness. Note,
remember minimum combat DCVs.

|====

Multiple Light Sources: Range goes as the square root (sqrt) of the total
light (round range in hexes down). In general, use GM's discretion.

Interaction of various light / dark sources:

==== Darkness vs. Light Spells

Light can be used to counter darkness and vice versa using standard
countering pluses but *without* a bonus for a continuing spell. If the
spells are cast independently, in the area where they overlap the effects
cancel (no mater how much Pow is put into the spells) and the prevailing
non-magical light conditions apply. Use of multiple light or dark spells
does not cancel this effect.

Darkness spell and natural light:

A person carrying a torch does not fight at minuses in a darkness, but they
need to use one hand to hold the torch. Flash powder only works in the
target hex in darkness (A roll against low to hit is required, or the target
can move out of a hex).

Ranged weapons: Firing a ranged weapon or spell into darkness takes the
darkness minus on the to-hit. Firing a ranged weapon into a lit area does
not take a "light" minus for Darkness Creatures.

Mass weapons fire into darkness ares: Assume fire is divided equally among
hexes and use mass fire rules.

==== Swarms

Some small creatures (wasps, rats, etc) attack in groups. The entire group
is treated as a single creature. The HP are proportional to the number of
creatures involved. Engage / disengage is based only on the movement - if
they can reach, they can attack. Swarms have a Low / Med / High attack
damage (all simultaneous). (usually only high is important). Attack damage
is treated like auto fire: First at normal, next 2 at -1, next 4 at -2.

==== Special Weapons

Flame thrower: Single target. Damage goes as plus^2^. Can be used area
effect, with total of 20d6 to divide among hexes. (target can move out of
range). If detonated (1% chance per point of damage through armor), does
30d6 explosion damage.

Grenade: Does d20 explosive. Note, can hit target (eg explode at exactly the
correct time. Then target takes center hex damage). NOTE: if roll+plus < 3,
then grenade explodes in hand.

C4: Explosive. Each ounce does 5d6 explosive damage., or 100 points X
demolitions roll.

==== Guns

Pistol: Any hand pistol, various eras. Typical 38 caliber revolver 1 shot /
round, then 6 rounds to reload

Rifle: Classic medium weight rifle 30.06 rifle, 1 shot / 2 rounds.

Shotgun: 12 gage. 2shots (can be fired in same round for 2X damage, but
wielder takes d6 damage from recoil. 1 round to reload each barrel

Elephant gun: 0.600 Nitro express or similar. 2 barrels. Takes 10 rounds to
reload each. Each shot causes wielder to take (2d6-size+) damage. Can fire
both barrels, but take (4d6 - size+ )damage

Quick draw (gun speed). Can drop that many pluses on gun to go first.

==== Combat actions summary

Absolute plus (abs) indicates that 3d6 is rolled, but no character based
values are used for MEDIUM DCV. Other pluses are relative to the character's
normal combat values. Shifting of pluses is only allowed when "n" is listed.
Normal move is movement / 2 (round up) unless otherwise noted. DCV in combat
is never worse than -4 absolute.

|====

[1] In normal combat, you may shift up to two Pluses to attack or DCV. That
is, increasing your Attack by 1 or 2 decreases your DCV by the same amount,
and vice-versa. The shift must be announced before the GM's dice roll is
revealed. If announced during the Engage phase, it affects your Engage Plus
by the same amount.

[2] Charge Attacks must be in a straight line. Add +10% / hex damage up to a
maximum of 100% (2X). Add +3 to engage. Defender may plant weapon (spear or
similar) to get same damage multiple

[3] Missile Weapon aiming bonuses can only be applied if the target is not
moving faster than a walk, and is not in combat. The player may take no
other actions during an aiming round.

The practical skill of farming. Includes knowing which crops to grow. An
even roll will allow you to make the normal amount of money for an acre of
land. Each +1 will increase / decrease the profits by 20%.

=== Alchemy

Creating various potions - related to magic. Potions listed as Magic -
_item_ require magic, and are partially based on magical abilities. Potions
listed as Alchemy - _item_ do not have magical components, and are only
based on alchemy ability (and specific potion ability). Note that time spent
on an alchemical potion produces the same pluses as for magical casting.

Alchemical potions can be created in bulk, take a -1 for each X3 in quantity
produced.

Record the plus at which a potion is constructed. Roll for success when
used.

==== Acid

The spell creates a strong acid (like sulfuric) which will eat through most
base metals. It will do some damage (d6/bottle) if thrown, but that is not
its primary intended use. Minimum creation time is 10 minutes. Can be made
in almost any quantity. Requires some common minerals. The acid will last
indefinitely. Difficulty 8. EP 250. Components 1 SP / bottle.

==== Alpine Snuff

Cocaine, Each dose is .01 gram. Requires 10 minutes to make. Requires parts
of some rare plants. EP 1000 Difficulty 12. Components 1 SP / dose (if
available)

==== Berserk Strength

(PCP) Gives 2X damage on all attacks (not defenses) for 10 rounds of combat.
Then at -1 for all combat due to fatigue. Subject does not know when they
take damage until they are dead. They may fight normally until dead. Subject
must always go at least +2 to offense if in hand to hand. Subject must
attempt to engage in hand to hand combat. If fighting multiple opponents,
subject may tactically disengage from all if the GB believes this has a
reasonable chance of resulting in combat with at least one opponent. Subject

Difficulty 8, 250 EP. Coal and oil.

==== Cheez Whiz Bomb (Silly Campaign Rules)

Used like a grenade, it coats everything within a 3 hex radius with sticky,
bright yellow cheesy goo. All non-sentient creatures find the goo tasty, and
will attempt to eat it in preference to anything else in the area (including
the PCs). This is an effective way to distract any creature that attacks
purely out of hunger. It will typically take a minute for a creature to eat
all of the Cheez Whiz in a hex. The nutritional value of Cheez Whiz is
similar to that of a similar amount of cheese. Difficulty -7, EP 250,
components: Yellow dye, sugar, corn starch, salt, vegetable oil. (no
cheese).

==== Fire Shield

Gives 50% damage resistance to all fire attacks, and 5 points / round
defense on any damage which gets through the 50%. Reduces all dexterity

been converted from Magic - Flash Powder. Flash powder is thrown using the
Combat - Thrown Weapon Plus to hit the target (normal a hex, sometimes an
opponent). It takes effect at the end of the special actions phase of the
round in which it is thrown. Components: Charcoal, sulfur, alum, silver,
mercury. Component cost is 10 SP. Difficulty 8, EP 100.

|====

==== Flash Superpowder

Similar to normal Flash powder, but also has the effect of sunlight on the
undead. Damage to undead is 3d6 * 100 points explosive (see rules under
explosions: full damage in center hex, 1/10 damage at 10 hexes, 1/r^2^
beyond that. ) Uses 1 oz. mithril for each unit produced. Difficulty 10, EP
500

==== Fuel Air Bomb

For high level / silly campaigns only. The alchemist prepares a bottle of
liquid which fills a room with mist. When ignited, the mixture explodes.
Each unit fills a cubic hex with explosive gas, and will do 10d6 damage in a
5 hex radius, then dropping to 5d6 out to 10 hexes, then 2d6 to 15 hexes.
Increasing the quantity of explosive will increase the radius of damage as
the square root of the quantity. Unlike nitro, fuel air explosives do not
detonate accidently. Use: Potion must be activated, then placed on the
ground. 1 to 5 rounds later it can be detonated by any source of ignition in
the central hex. Components: Petroleum, sulfur. Can be manufactured in
quantity. Difficulty 8, EP 500.

melting point ice. The resulting material has a melting point of about 100
degrees C, and mechanical properties like soft rock. Components: Sand, iron
ore, chalk, trace platinum (1 oz. / 100 m^3^). Mixture must be
frozen (at normal water freezing temperature), then will not melt until
boiling temperature. 1 "unit - pint bottle" will convert 1 m^3^.

gas that flows mostly downhill, in a layer about 10' thick. Gas will spread
at 5 hexes / round from source to maximum size, then flow downhill at 2
hexes / round. One bottle affects a 20 hex radius. Gas will persist for
several hours. Damage is 3d6/round if target is breathing, d6 / round if

awakened normally for a deep sleeper. Targets must roll senses (use combined
senses roll) at-5 to detect the vapors. Then, each individual must make a
con roll at -5 or fall asleep. If any target does not sleep, they may
notice, and wake others (alertness roll at typically +0). Area of effect is
20 hex radious per bottle (liter). Note: will drift in wind. Components:
plant materials, limestone, spring water. EP 500, Difficulty 10.

==== Slippery Liquid

A liquid which reduces friction to almost nothing. Can be used for various
mechanisms, or in combat to make opponents slip (acrobatics roll if passing
through the area or fall (-4 defense, no attack next round). Each unit
(about a pint) will cover 1 megahex of ground. Only works on non-porous
surfaces (stone, wood, metal, etc). Will not work on dirt. EP 100 Difficulty

contact with boiling water (treat as 130 degree F water). Does not protect
against fire, or non-volcanic gasses. EP 250, Difficulty 7. Components:
sulfur, Redwood bark, spring water. Potion lasts 1 day.

=== Alcohol Making

The person creating alcohol prepares a "batch". The default size is 10
drinks and take 1 hour to produce and costs 1 SP. The size of a batch can be
doubled for -1 on the roll.

The plus can also be increased by 1 by spending 10X on ingredients.

Anything worse than -5 is undrinkable.

Drinking rolls done at the plus for the batch.

For plus < 0, take d6 damage for each negative plus.

If Silly Drinking Rules are not in use, use the following.

.Drinking Rolls
[options="header"]
|====
| Plus   | Effect
| 0 to 2 | Acceptable booze
| 5 to 3 | Good, +1 on morale
| 9 to 6 | Excellent, +2 on morale
| 10+    | Legendary, +3 on morale
|====

=== Alertness

Alertness is ``jungle honed reflexes''. It is the ability to notice (as
opposed to sense) things. A senses roll would be used to try to see a
distant object you knew was there. Alertness would be used to notice a bird
flying high overhead. Note that alertness has a very strong senses
correlation. You get to use your alertness plus against an opponent's
stealth roll.

=== Animal Handling

This is the ability to work with animals. A successful animal-handling roll
will prevent a vicious (but not carnivorous, or trained) animal from
attacking. A roll at +3 will prevent a non-intelligent (but even
carnivorous) animal from attacking. Animal Handling is also used to control
or alter trained animal behavior. Animal trained to guard its master would
not require a roll, but would require one to guard to guard someone other
than its master. If an animal is urged to do a trained task that is
particularly difficult a animal handling roll will be required. (e.g.
Commanding a guard dog to sit or even attack a normal creature would not
require a roll, but to attack a natural predator to the animal would.)
Animal Handling is used for specific situations to get an animal to do
something for which it has not been trained. If a situation persists
successive rolls may be required (at GM's discretion). Typically subsequent
rolls are +1 for each success and -2 for each failure.

.Animal Handling Rolls
[options="header"]
|====
| Plus              | Typical Effect
| +6                | Animal is devoted to handler. (domesticated Pet that is very well taken care of)
| +4                | Animal is loyal to handler. Handler is considered the animals "master" or alpha or handler trained the animal.
| +2                | Animal knows and trusts handler (is the pet of a friend of handler)
| +Training Success | Animal is trained for task: add the training roll success margin. If GM allows the success margin should be kept with the trained animal's stat. (i.e. must have been trained in advance.) (note: animals can be trained in 1 month at: +0; about 3 hours at: -5; about 7 minutes at: -8 )
| 0                 | Animal was trained for task but is nervous for some reason (crowd, predator in the area, unusual smells, loud noises that the animal wasn't trained to ignore)
| -1                | Animal is trained for a conflicting task. (trained to hunt rabbits but asked to sit and ignore a rabbit)
| -2                | Animal is confused or has conflicting loyalties. (cumulative with devotion pluses. If conflict is with a devoted master modifiers: -1 and -3 )
| -2                | Animal is frightened. Animal doesn't want to do task. Animal doesn't clearly understand task.
| -4                | Animal is terrified.. Animal cannot clearly understand task. Animal risks death or serious injury
| -6                | Action goes against animal's basic instinctive reactions.
| +Int              | Successful Animal Empathy / Psi-Animal Communicate then Plus animal's int. Typical animal Int is 1-3.
|====

At GM discretion, communicating with a hostile animal may not help other
than to provide a level of intimidation or a common understanding of intent.

=== Animal Training

This is the ability to train domestic, or possibly non-domesticated animals
to perform as required. Typically it will take a month to train an animal.
There is a plus (minus) one for each factor of 3 in time. Additional Pluses
(minuses) to animal training roll.

.Animal Training Rolls
[options="header"]
|====
| Plus       | Typical Effect
| +2         | Train a domesticated animal in its "normal" function. Dog barking (only) at strangers, etc
| +1         | Train a riding horse
| +0         | Train a war horse, guard dog,
| -1         | Train a show horse (train to do non-normal functions consistently on command)
| -2         | Train a non-domesticated animal (cumulative with other numbers)
| -3         | Train a Dizbuster for riding
| +Int       | Successful Animal Empathy / Psi-Animal Communicate then Plus animal's int.
| -1         | Animal is ferocious (Guard Wolf vs guard dog)
| -4 or more | Animal is vicious or enchanted creature with animal int. (GM discretion)
|====

==== Examples

A character with successful Animal Communicate and +3 in Animal Training
trains a wild wolf for 12 months to act as a guard animal. The modifiers
are:

  * Not domesticated: -2
  * Time 12 Months: +4
  * Wolf INT: +3
  * Ferocious: -1
  * Skill: +3

For a total of +7.

Training a falcon for 12 months to be a hunting bird has modifiers:

  * Not domesticated: -2
  * Time 12 months: +4
  * Falcon INT: +2
  * Non-normal function: -1
  * Skill: +3

For a total of +6.

Training a ferret scout for 12 months has modifiers:

  * Not domesticated: -2
  * Time 12 months: +4
  * Ferret INT: +2
  * Non-normal function: -1
  * Skill: +3

For a total of +6.

==== Guard Animal Commands

Roll at +7 training roll for each command, except as noted.

  * Have and obey one master and ignore commands not from master:
    (temporarily changing masters requires control roll at minus "training
    success" plus modifiers)
  * Not be distracted by battle noises.
  * Use senses to alert master of danger. The animal is always alert; if
    commanded to silence, it will nuzzle or otherwise silently get attention
    of master).
  ** Add -2 to the silence command training roll, because it is very
    un-natural.
  * Guard master from attackers (always guarding unless commanded to heel,
    sic, or protect. Will attack anything physically attacking master. May
    require a handling roll if negative condition exists.
  * Attack a target specified by master: (command *Sic* _point at target_):
    will attack until defeated or called off. May require handling roll if
    negative condition exists or if severely injured.
  * Protect an area, item, or person if commanded to do so (command
    *Protect* _point at thing to protect, or touch / show thing to protect_)
    will guard the thing it's protecting, even if master gets attacked. The
    animal will attempt to keep the thing from moving away if it is animate.
    This may require handling roll if negative conditions exist, or if
    master has difficulty communicating what to protect).
  ** Add -1 to the training roll. Not natural, and difficult.
  * Fetch an object (command *Fetch* _point at thing to fetch or throw thing
    to fetch_). May require handling roll if negative conditions exists or
    if master has difficulty communicating what to fetch.
  * Perform pet tricks (sit, lie down, roll over, stay, come, common things
    learned during first stages of animal training).

The animal knows the following commands at the training success Plus. Roll
separately for each command:

  ** Sit @ ___
  ** Down @ ___
  ** Stay @ ___
  ** Guard @ ___
  ** Protect @ ___
  ** Sic @ ___
  ** Heel @ ___,
  ** Come @ ___
  ** Fetch @ ___
  ** Silence @ ___.

==== Hunting (Scout) Animal

  * Fetch Prey (command *gesture*). Animal will go / fly in indicated
    direction looking for natural prey, If possible, it will attack and kill
    the prey and return it without eating it. Typically trained to limit to
    a specific prey.
  ** Add +1 to the training roll, for a natural act.
  * Seek specified Prey (command *gesture*). Master must communicate prey to
    seek (i.e. let a hound smell something of the prey). Animal will stay
    near prey and circle above, bay / howl, or otherwise indicate its
    presence. An Animal Handling or Animal Communicate roll may be necessary
    to indicate prey to seek.
  * Scout specified Prey (command *gesture*). Master must communicate prey to
    scout. Animal returns when found or after about an hour if not found and
    attempts to communicate. Communication without Animal Communicate is
    very limited. (found prey / didn't find prey / in that direction).
  ** Add -1 to the training roll. Not natural.
  *  Scout for danger (command *gesture*). The animal needs to be trained for
    what indicates danger. Animal Communication is essential for any
    flexibility in this otherwise the definition must be natural enemy or
    pre-defined condition (other humans, large creatures, etc.) Animal
    handling or Animal communicate roll necessary to indicate what danger
    is.
  ** Add -2 to the training roll. Not natural.
  * Scout (command: animal communication. This can only be done with Animal
    Communication. Animal will follow instructions and communicate
    information. This is limited by animal's INT and ability to understand
    instructions and to understand what is observed. Animal Handling and
    Animal Communication rolls required.)
  ** Add -3 to the training roll. This is a very useful and difficult skill.
  * Return(command <gesture> or "call" or animal communicate. Animal returns
    to master.)
  * Flee(command<gesture> animal returns to home. Animal handling or Animal
    communication roll required if home is beyond the understanding of the
    animal.

The animal knows the following commands at the training success Plus. Roll
separately for each command:

  * Fetch * ___
  * Seek * ___
  * Scout prey * ___
  * Scout danger * ____
  * Scout * ____,
  * Return * ____
  * Flee * ___

=== Anthropology

This is the knowledge of primitive cultures, and the ability to interact
with them. Typically a flat roll would be required to make peaceful contact
with a group of primitives. Some effects of other rolls:

.Anthropology Rolls
[options="header"]
|====
| Roll | Typical Effect
| +10  | Convince them that you are a GOD
| +5   | Convince them to join and accept your culture
| +2   | Establish favorable trading relations
| 0    | Establish peaceful contact
| -2   | Escape without violence
| -5   | They will hunt you down
| -10  | They will apply all of their cultural energy to destroying you and all that is yours.
|====

=== Archeology

This is the study of ancient civilizations and ruins. A flat archeology roll
allows the character to identify the culture, and age (to 50% - unless
defined more accurately by the knowledge of the culture) of an artifact from
a known civilization. Each +1 cuts the age uncertainty in half. This is also
the ability to find interesting things in ruins. Typically the GM will
define a required archeology roll to find some important artifact or piece
of information.

=== Bargaining

This is the ability to convince someone to sell at a lower price. Roll with
bargaining skill, For each 1 difference the price will multiply or divide by
the purchase "variance percentage". For typical (food, weapons, etc)
purchases, the variance is 10%. An equal roll is no change. For example a +2
roll would divide the price by 1.2. NOTE: you cannot hire someone to bargain
for you (after all, you would need to bargain for hiring them).

.Bargaining Effects
[options="header"]
|====
| Item      | Retail / Wholesale typical | Variance
| Gold      | 1                          | 0%
| Gems      | 1.5                        | 10%
| Food      | 2                          | 10%
| Weapons   | 2                          | 20%
| Artifacts | 4                          | 50%
|====

=== Child Care

This is the skill of raising, educating and controlling children. It is not
normally useful in the game.

=== Climbing

The climbing skill allows you to climb anything more difficult than a
ladder. A roll must be made for each standard distance, or part of a
standard distance climbed.

==== Climbing speeds

Normal clmibing speed is 1'/round, max 20'/minute, 300'/hour for long
climbs, 2000'/day for day climbs. Climb rolls are based on the distance to
be climbed. Rolls below are for 10' climbs. All climb rolls are made for a
minimum of 10'. Climbs are at -1 for each factor of 10 in climbing distance
(up to 1 day). Climbs can be made faster (up to 1 hex / round) at -1 for
each additional foot / round. Roll each round.

.Climbing Modifiers
[options="header"]
|====
| Type of Climb                                              | Difficulty
| Tree with lots of branches, rope                           | -9
| Snow slope                                                 | -8
| Mountainside - Teneya canyon                               | -7
| Glacier - Ice covered cliffs, Outside of typical building, | -6
| Rock cliff - Yosemite valley walls, siege ladder           | -5
| Tree - no branches                                         | -4
| Rock face - Halfdome                                       | -3
| Poorly made stone wall                                     | -2
| Good stone wall (typical castle)                           | +2
| Overhang - rock                                            | +4
| Overhang - good stonework                                  | +6
| Vertical wall of glass (without th'pocks), otherwise 0.    | +8
| With appropriate equipment (petons, Ice Axe, etc)          | +3 extra
|====

If you fail your climbing roll, you did not succeed in moving climbing in
that round. Roll again at the same plus to catch yourself. If you fail, you
fall. For each climb a typical falling distance should be defined. For
example: for Half Dome, the distance is 2000'. For a rubble slope, the
distance might only be 20'. After a fall, roll d100 % of this to find the
distance you actually fell. Damage is d6/5'. Armor does not protect.

==== Fixed ropes

If you are roped to a fixed location, the damage is d6/20' falling, the rope
will limit the distance you fall. Note, climbing with fixed ropes reduces
you climbing speed to 1/4 normal. In this case, only one climber must roll
the difficult climb. Minimum fall damage is d6.

==== Party roped together

This allows you to climb at normal rate. If one person falls, any neighbors
get to roll a climb roll at -2. If either succeeds, things are OK. If all
neighbors fail, the next in line must make the roll at -4, then -6, etc. If
all fail, all fall (and die?).

==== Effects of altitude

For each 3000' above 10000', take a -1 at all skills.

=== Demolitions

This is the knowledge of how to destroy physical structures. When attacking
a structure, each +1 on a Demolitions roll gives a x2 on the amount of
damage done to the structure. A demolitions roll is a full round action. A
structure designed by a superior engineer may be resistant to demolitions.
In that case, roll demolitions plus against the engineering plus.

=== Disguise

The ability to make yourself or another look like someone else. It is always
assumed that you have sufficient clothes, etc to at least be plausible.

.Disguise Modifiers
[options="header"]
|====
| Situation                                                     | Plus
| Disguising another                                            | -1 (additive)
| Trying to look like a different human race                    | -2 (additive)
| Trying to look like a different humanoid species              | -4 (additive)
| Trying to look like a non-human (silly)                       | -6 (additive)
| Full set of disguise equipment (several trunks worth)         | +2(additive)
| No equipment (but able to find minimum clothes, etc)          | -2 (additive)
| Trying not to be recognized as self                           | +3
| Trying to look like a specific type of person (A guard)       | +0
| Trying to look like a specific person to strangers (The duke) | -2
| Trying to look like a specific person to an acquaintance      | -5
|====

=== Engineering

This is the ability to construct devices and buildings and strange
mechanisms.

==== Clockwork creature construction

Base cost for clockwork creature: 10 gold.

Base time to build clockwork creature: 1 week

Basic creature stats: +0/5 0/0/0 10 HP, move 0, preprogrammed +
behavior

  * -1 for each additional attack plus
  * -1 for each additional 5 points of attack damage
  * -1 for +1 to Med DCV / parry ++10
  * -1 for +1 to High DCV / defense ++10
  * -1 for each 2 hexes of movement

  * -1 reprogramable
  * -3 voice controlled
  * -5 animal level intelligence

  * +1 doubling of time
  * +1 doubling of cost
  * +2 for each engineering plus

So, if you wanted to build a clockwork tiger: +5/25 0/3/5 parry 30 defense
20 Move 8 Animal Intelligence, the engineer would be at minus -23. If they
were a +7(14) engineer and spent 320 gold(+5) and 64 weeks(+6), they would
be at +2.

If they only had a week and ten gold and wanted to build something to defend
his entryway. +4/30 0/0/5 defense 50.

==== Golem Construction

Bronze Golem: Materials cost 20 GP. Requires an Engineering roll at -13 +
bonus for time spent taken from the <<casting-time,Spell Casting Time
Modifiers>> table with your Engineering Plus. On failure, the materials are
destroyed. 1 engineer (+0 or more) year, + 100 worker years to produce.

Standard bronze golem is 6/5 +5/30 5/9/15 250/100/2000 1/2 dam from fire or
cold.

Iron Golem: Materials cost 100 GP. Requires engineering roll at -15 (or
materials destroyed). 2 engineer years and 500 worker years.

Standard Iron golem is : 7/6 +6/60 6/10/16 500/200/5000 1/10 dam fire or
cold.

Golem repair: Each day, engineering roll, rather than healing roll for
number of dice.

Golems with souls. Take best combat skill (skill plus, not weapon plus),
-4, add to golem pluses.

Other golem skills:

  * Stealth -10
  * Climbing -3 (damage from falling 10x due to weight)
  * Weight 1 ton
  * Acrobatics -10

based on a real deity): Roll at religion plus plus (or minus) the log~2~ of
the number of brownie points give below. For specific gods, especially those
created during the game, the rules for intervention may be different.

=== Spelunking

The ability to find your way around underground caves and tunnels. Typically
a flat roll is required to avoid getting lost for a full day's travel
underground. If lost, a roll at -1 for each day lost is required to find

(or one hour). Use +1 for each factor of 10 less time, down to +4 each
round, -1 for each factor of 2 more time. Some typical swimming rolls. If a
roll is missed, take d6 damage for each point missed.

== Elemental Magic

This is an independent type of magic from the standard system, appropriate
for certain types of very high magic worlds. Mages are experts in single
elements and cannot have spells in more than one element. Each element obeys
different rules. This system does not use Pow.

A mage must _connect_ to the elemental power they are using. This requires
an elemental magic roll at -5. Once connected the mage can stay connected as
long as they wish.

A mage must have a gem for their element. A 10 ct. gem gives +0, each factor
of 2 size above or below gives +/- 1. This applies to spell casting and
attack pluses. Other gems may also work. Diamond will work for all types of
magic.

.Elemental Magic Gems
[options="header"]
|====
| Element      | Gem Type
| Air / Water  | Sapphire or Tanzanite
| Earth / Fire | Ruby or Garnet (need 4X weight)
| Life         | Emerald or Bloodstone.
| Death        | Black Opal or Obsidian (1 ounce counts as 1ct)
|====

_A mage may cast multiple spells with -2 for each subsequent spell. Spells
generally last until canceled by the mage._


=== Air / Water / Storm

*Weather Conditions:* A roll is required to move the weather away from its
non-magic enhanced level. The roll is at -3 for the starting number of steps
away from the non-magic level. A one round roll is done at flat, +1 for
every factor of 10 in time. If the mage disconnects, weather will return to
normal at one box per hour. Mages can contest the weather - use the
difference in rolls as the net plus in either direction. A roll at every
hour is done at net +3.

[NOTE]
====
Weather effects on sailing or outdoor survival are combined with
temperature, ocean and other modifiers.

devastated area. Plus =-10

== Magic and Psi

Your plus with a spell is given on the character sheet. In order for a spell
to work, you must equal a 3d6 roll + plus, against a flat 3d6. Note that
many spells have negative pluses. Increasing casting time increase the plus
for spells.


=== Casting Spells

==== Spell casting requirements

Comment: There must be a way to prevent a mage from casting spells other
than by killing them. Otherwise, any captured mage will immediately be
executed, with undesirable plot implications. Typically one (or both) of the
two following options is used in the game:

  * *Focus:* Each magician has a personal _focus_, usually an amulet. If the
    focus is removed, *no* spells can be cast. A magician can make a new
    focus in a few weeks. A magician's focus is useless to any other
    magician. This rule applies only to humans. Some creatures have inherent
    magic and can cast it without a focus.
  * *Iron handcuffs:* Magic may be stopped by a particular substance,
    typically iron. A magician cannot cast spells when in contact with that
    material. Contact with this material does *not* reduce Pow to zero.

==== Pluses and Pow

Each character has a Magic - General Plus (abbreviated as _GM+_) which is
used when specified, such as when countering of rolling a combat plus when
casting a direct spell on an opponent.

In addition there are pluses for casting each individual spell. Note that a
character's GM+ is typically high (+5 to +10), while the plus for individual
spell is typically low, often negative. Each character also has a listed
magical Pow. These Pow points are expended to cast spells (see later in this
section).

==== Casting Time

Increasing casting time improves the plus for casting spells. For many
spells, long casting times are the only way to obtain reasonable pluses.
Note that some spells have minimum casting times. They still gain pluses for
time spent, but cannot be cast in less than the minimum time.

Note that one cannot simply be "preparing" a spell indefinitely. Specific
preparations are required. Symbols must be drawn, devices constructed, etc.
Mages can not be "holding" a spell at all times or it is assumed they are
obnly gaining EP in that particular spell.

| 1 day                | +8   | May start spell in different location
| 1 week               | +9   | Other actions may be taken normally, no roll required.
| 3 months             | +10  | Spell may be interrupted without cost.
| 2 years              | +11  | ..
| 20 years             | +12  | Spell research may be transferred to another magician.
|====

In some campaigns, spells have listed casting times and pluses. These pluses
(which are always better than the normal casting time plus) can be used for
fixed casting time spells.

==== Casting

The casting mage applies Pow to the spell, and rolls at the spell plus (with
any time modifiers) against the universe. If the roll equal or higher than
the universe the spell is cast (but may be countered later). If the spell
misses by exactly 1 plus, the spell is a fumble. In a fumble something BAD
happens - up to the GM discretion. If the roll misses by more than one, the
spell fails, and the Pow goes "uncontrolled" (see later chart).

Multiple Spells: Magicians casting multiple spells in a single round take
the usual -2 for each additional spell. There is no penalty for casting an
additional spell while maintaining another.

==== Symbol spells

The magician creates a symbol that is then activated by applying Pow. The
exact effect of the spell must be decided when the symbol is drawn. The
symbol always operates at a fixed Pow level. If the symbol construction roll
fails, the symbol cannot be repaired, and must be re-created from scratch.
The spell is cast by applying Pow, a magic roll at -5 is required. 5 rounds
are required to activate a symbol spell. No time pluses are gained.

Symbols may be filled gradually with Pow and then used. The Pow in a symbol
may not be tapped off for other uses (except for storage symbols).

A symbol may be carved by a group of mages working together. Mages with
lower pluses can combine their efforts (using the plus summing rule) to aid
the main magician. The work is divided by the number of groups of mages
whose skills sum to that of the main mage. Unskilled labor can be used for
very large symbols (max 1 laborer / hex). For each factor of 10 in laborers
relative to magicians, the construction time is divided by 2. The original
casting of the spell is at -8 (but count the full time for symbol creation).
Symbol spells are not allowed in some campaigns.

Symbols can be used for Pow storage as well as for spell casting. Note that
some spells require specific types of gems or other materials for symbols.

|====

Sample symbol spell: "Flesh to stone" on a gem by a mage who is -2 at flesh
to stone +8 magic general. Pow is 20, so a <1 ct. gem is required. The
original casting is at -10, so 3 months is required to reach +0. Carving the
gem is only an additional 20 hours (3 days). The completed gem will allow
the mage to cast the spell at +3 after 5 rounds. Normally, after 5 rounds,
the mage would be at +0, and 32 rounds would be required to reach +3.

Sample symbol spell: "Lightning bolt" by a mage who is +0 at lightning bolt,
and +8 magic general, 100 Pow in spell. A 4 ct. gem (16 GP) is required. 3
months would give a +2 casting the spell. Carving the gem requires 100
hours. The completed gem allows casting after 5 rounds at +3. Mage would
normally be +2 after 5 rounds and +3 after 8 rounds, so this is of marginal
use.

Sample symbol spell: "Gate" spell to Yuggoth, 100 hex area, cast by
arch-Lich (GM+ of 13) with 100,000 slaves as carved stone symbol: Spell is
at +0, Pow is 1 million. Casting time is 2years for spell to reach +3,
Symbol is 10,000 ft^2^, 1 million hours time. 100,000 slaves give 2^5^
factor = 1/32 casting time, or about 3000 hours = 1.5 years. Will need to
build an equal size symbol to store the Pow = 1.5 additional years. After
creation can cast spell at +8.

Sample symbol spell: Book (scroll) of "army of darkness" cast by an insane
mage who is +11 general magic, -3 at army of darkness. Cast for 1 mi.^2^
(10,000 hexes). Pow is 10,000. Will need a 100-page book. Will require
50,000 hours for Pow (25 years!). Plus after 20 years is +12, -3 for spell,
-8 for symbol = +1 net (he is crazy remember). The 100 page book requires
100 minutes to cast, but will go at +9. (otherwise their plus would be +4
(after120 minutes), but would need somewhere to store Pow.

Note: Scroll spells are a special case of symbol spells.

==== Magic Books

A mage may cast a spell by following the directions in a spell book. Note
that the spell book is not itself magical. Minimum casting time is 1 hour.
For fixed casting time spells, use the larger of the fixed casting time and
1 hour, using the time plus appropriate for the fixed time spell. Spells are
cast at: general_magic_plus - 2 - spell_difficulty + time_plus.

==== Effects of armor on magic

In general, armor will stop damage from indirect spells the same way it does
for weapon attacks (either direct, or area effect). Armor improves high DCV
and thereby improves protection against direct spells. See table in weapons
section for armor protection.

==== Permanent spells

Some spells can be made permanent. The spell must be cast at -5 (in addition
to all other minuses). Pow =(1+ log~2~ (duration / original duration)) *
original Pow.

Sample permanent spell: An earth mage who wants permanent body of stone, he
is normally -2 at the spell, which requires 120 Pow + 10 Pow / round to
maintain. For 200 Pow, the spell would normally last 8 rounds (16 seconds).
If we want 100 years, we need about 2^28^ time increase, so the Pow will be
5600 Pow. Casting will be at -5 (or net -7). After 3 months would have a +3
casting.

Sample Permanent symbol spell: Use the above permanent body of stone, cast
by an arch mage who is +11 general, +2 at the spell, creating a scroll. The
Pow is 5600, so the scroll (book) is 56 pages (will take 30,000 hours, or
about 15 years). Casting is at -8, -5 or -13. With the mage +2, and 20 years
work we get a net +1 (pretty scary), but when cast, the book can be used in
1 hour at net +6 to create stone warriors.


=== Magical Pow

==== Types of Pow

Each magician has a personal Pow and Pow regeneration rate (equal to MAG
stat each minute) listed on their character sheets. There are several ways
to store / transfer Pow.

Note: Some worlds have higher or lower Pow regeneration rates, up to MAG
stat / round.

Personal Pow: This Pow is always available for use, and automatically acts
as a defense against outside spells. Pow may be freely transferred out of
personal Pow.

Storage symbol: Pow may be stored in a carved symbol using the standard Pow
storage spell. This allows the casting of very large spells if there is time
to prepare a symbol. See section on symbol spells.

==== Pow Sources

In addition to a magician's natural regeneration of Pow, other Pow sources
can be used. No special training is required to use these sources, only a
roll a your GM+. If two magicians are trying to control the same Pow source,
they may share, or they can make rolls at GM+ to see who gains control each
round. Casting the "channel" spell allows Pow from any of the following
sources to be collected at range. Otherwise, the magician must be in contact
with the effect, or use a Pow storage symbol.

Death: The death of a human (or other intelligent creature) releases 20X
their MAG stat in Pow. Magician must be in contact (or have a special spell)
to collect this Pow. Mass human sacrifices can be used to cast very large
spells.

Lightning: A bolt of lightning contains 200 Pow. The magician needs to have
some mechanism (eg symbol) to store the Pow. Note that call lightning can be
used to gather the Pow. The lightning must strike a specifically designed
lightning rod.

Volcano: An erupting volcano releases 100 Pow / round.

==== Combining Pow

Multiple mages can only combine Pow if each makes a general magic roll. If
any fail, all of the combined Pow of the mages goes uncontrolled.

==== Detecting Pow

Active or stored Pow may be detected at a range of 10 * sqrt(Pow) in hexes.
Also, anyone within the area of effect of a direct or indirect spell can
detect the casting of the spell. Note that "area of effect" is defined by
the GM, but generally the smallest reasonable definition is used.


=== Basic Spell Types.

==== Direct single target

Example a death spell cast on an individual. The magician chooses a quantity
of excess Pow for the spell to overcome the target's resistance. The
magician rolls to see if the spell is successful. If it is, the target has a
chance to counter. (See section on countering spells). If the counter fails,
the target has a chance to dodge. The Magician rolls at their base GM+
against the target's HIGH DCV. On an equal roll, the spell hits. If the
spell hits, and if its additional Pow exceeds the target's Pow, the spell
takes effect. Note, the target Pow is unchanged after the attack. Note,
target can still perform normal combat actions that round. Note that for
symbol spells, the mage may add Pow to overcome the target's resistance
while not changing the Pow in the original symbol.

==== Indirect single target

Example: a magic missile cast on an individual. The magician rolls to see if
the spell is successful. If it is, the target has a chance to counter. If
the counter fails, the magician rolls an attack with their base GM+ against
the target DCV - as if the spell was a standard missile attack.

==== Area effect - direct

Example: mass death spell. These spells always take effect on the magic
phase after the one in which they are cast. These spells must always have a
visible effect - fog for example. The defender can move up to their full
move to get out of the area of effect before the spell takes effect. If the
defender cannot move out of the area, roll against the defender's Powas for
a single target direct spell.

==== Area effect - indirect

Example: fireball. These spells take effect on the round after the one in
which they are cast. Defenders have a chance to try to run out of the area
of effect.

==== Area effect - animate

Example: animate ground. These spells create a number of combatants who
attack according to the rules for the spells.

==== Ranged Spells

It costs 1 Pow / hex of range for direct spells. All indirect spells have a
listed spell range.

==== Continuing Spells

These are spells which can be maintained indefinitely at some Pow cost.
Examples are _Body of Stone_, Create _Darkness_, _Vigor_, etc. With the
exception of the Pow requirements, continuing these spells does not in any
other way affect the casting magician. If the casting magician is disabled
the spell will end. If the casting magician is injured, or fails a spell
roll, a general magic roll is needed to maintain each spell. If no other
duration is given, 1 minute is assumed.

==== Permanent Spells

These are spells that continue without the expenditure of Pow. Examples:
_Permanent Sleep_, _Sanctuary_, _Flesh to Stone_, etc. These spells remain
in effect even after the death of the casting magician.

==== Permanent Alterations

These are spells that change the structure of the world. Examples: _Create
Rock_, Alchemical creations, etc. The effects of these spells cannot be
reversed magically. Even black iron will not affect them after they are
cast.


=== Countering spells

==== General Rules

A counter requires a minimum of 1 Pow for each spell countered, for each
magician countering. Note that some spells (indirect) must be countered at
range, and that range costs must be paid for the counter. Countering is very
effective, magical battles with multiple magicians are typically a draw. New
rule: Caster can add additional Pow to a spell to make it more difficult to
counter.

==== Which mages can counter

Any mage in the _area of effect_ of a spell can counter. The area of effect
includes any location that will take damage from, or be directly effected by
the spell. An "ice age" spell could be countered by anyone in the world. A
"summon demon lord" does NOT have any "area of effect", although the demon
summoned may later damage a very large area. Any spell can be detected and
countered to a range of sqrt(Pow) in hexes. Any mage within line of sight of
a spell casting may counter the spell.

==== Information about a spell before a counter

A magician within the area of effect of a spell will only learn the Pow in
the spell, not which spell is being cast until the counter is cast. If the
counter is successful, the mage will learn what spell was cast.

[NOTE]
====
In the past, a successful counter did not reveal what spell was cast.
====


==== Brute Force Counter

The defender rolls 3d6 at base GM+ Plus against the attacker. If the rolls
are equal, then the defender must use as much Pow as was in the original
spell. If the defender wins by N, then they must use 1/(N+1) of the Pow in
the original spell. If the defender loses by N, they must use (N+1) times
the Pow in the original spell. *All* unused Pow (including the countered
spell) goes uncontrolled. Either attacker, or defender may choose (or not)
to control the Pow. A mage may attempt to counter any number of different
spells.

==== Multiple Counters and multiple attacks

All attacking spells must first be declared in terms of their caster, and
the Pow involved.

Defending Mages then select which spells they wish to counter. In general
defending mages must make these decisions independently without
communication (there are only 2 seconds in a round). In the case of mages
who have worked together for a long time, in can be assumed that some
general set of rules has been agreed upon, and BRIEF discussion is allowed.
For non-communicating mages, assume a random selection of spells is
countered, and an even distribution of required Pow among counters.

For a mage countering multiple spell: 2 spells are counted at -2, 3-4 at -3,
5-8 at -4, etc.

The pluses for all counters against a single spell are added using the usual
plus adding rules: 2-3 counters at +2, 4-7 at +3, 8-15 +3, etc.

A single (combined) counter roll is made for each spell cast.

The defending mages divide the required counter Pow. If the mages have
trained together, they may choose the Pow division. Otherwise the required
Pow is divided evenly.

==== Countering Permanent Spells

These spells are more difficult to counter than standard spells (Note that
permanent alteration spells cannot be countered at all after they have been
cast). The countering magician must apply as much Pow as was in the original
spell. The counter is cast at -8 relative to the original spell. Time pluses
for counters are allowed. A "fumbled" (see section on spell casting) counter
is likely to cause the original spell to affect the countering magician.

==== Blocking Counters

Magic wall will prevent countering of a spell (in both directions), unless
the area of effect of the spell extends through the magic wall. In the later
case, the magic wall is destroyed by an outward going spell, and will block
an inward going spell. A lightning bolt cast from inside a magic wall could
be countered if it is targeted outside of the wall.

*Range Notes*: Counters do not need to have enough range to reach the
attacker. They can be cast at an intermediate range to stop ranged spell
attacks. The attack will then dissipate at that intermediate range. For
example, a direct spell such as a death spell only needs to be countered at
its target, not at its source. An indirect spell like lightning, however,
needs to be countered at its source.


=== Uncontrolled Pow and Fumbles

==== Uncontrolled Pow

When Magical Pow or Chaons are released, the mage rolls at (GM+ - 8) against
the universe. Start at the indicated Pow level and count down (but not up)
to determine the effects on a failed roll.

[[uncontrolled-pow-effects]]
.Uncontrolled Pow Effects
[options="header"]
|====
| Pow    | Plus | Effect
| <100   | 0    | *None*
| 100    | 6    | Gneeches (Small annoying, but harmless pan-dimensional insects).
| 200    | 7    | Fireball (cannot be countered) centered at casting point
| 500    | 8    | Ubu Beast
| 1000   | 9    | Mage polymorphs to frog (but retains magical abilities).
| 2000   | 10   | Karaken Demon
| 5000   | 11   | Hezrou Demon
| 10000  | 12   | 100 hex radius transported to alternate plane
| 20000  | 13   | 3d6 Ubu Beasts
| 50000  | 14   | d6 randomly generated chaos creatures created. (see chaos section for rules)

| 200000 | 16   | Summon Demon Queen
| 1M     | 17   | Summon Death elemental
| 2M     | 18   | Open gateway to hell / chaos
| 5M     | 19   | Summon Elder God
| 10M    | 20   | Summon Azothoth
|====

==== Fumbles

Fumbles occur when a spell caster misses the required plus by exactly 1
plus. The results of a fumble are up to the GM, but will by definition be
bad for the caster. Some sample fumbles are:

Lightning Bolt: Bolt is directed at caster, at normal Pow and caster's full
plus.

Body of Stone: Becomes flesh to stone on caster.

Summon: Summons the (very) wrong thing.


=== Learning Magic

Learning spells: In order to learn a spell, the character must have access
to spell books. Spell books (which are non-magical) are lengthy texts on the
theory and casting of a spell. A spell book may be copied by any reputable
book copier - but will require about a year to copy. Some spell books may be
restricted in some campaigns.

==== Magic - General

This is general knowledge / study of magic. Magic - General rolls are made
for counters, when rolling to hit with a direct spell, and other purposes as
specified.

==== Theoretical Magic

Theoretical Magic is required to create new spells and to attempt to
understand magical artifacts or effects.

Spell creation: New spells may be created with the GMs discretion. In
general an attempt can be made each week to create a new spell. Typically a
roll of +10 on Theoretical Magic is required. Of course the difficulty will
vary with the type of spell to be created. A full magical library is
required to create new spells.


=== Detecting Magic

General Rules: Magical Pow is detectable at a range of sqrt(Pow) in hexes.
This includes a magician's personal Pow, or Pow stored in a device. The
detection allows a general direction (within a 60 degree cone), but not
exact location of the source. A magic general roll (made by the GM) is
required to detect a spell. For each plus by which the roll is made, the
detection range is doubled. Note that detection does not automatically allow
countering.

Spell Detection: A spell can be usually be detected (to allow for
countering) anywhere inside its area of effect. This is an intentional
kludge to prevent the "surprise you're dead" effect from ranged spells. Some
spells may have specific detection ranges listed.


=== Black Iron

Black Iron is an anti-magical material found in some worlds. A gram of Black
Iron can absorb 1 Pow (each round). (Note, in some worlds, there is not
limit to absorption) If it absorbs more, it will detonate as an explosion,
producing 1 point base damage per Pow in the center megahex It has the
following effects:

Magician - A magician who touches black iron (must touch skin - e.g. hit
high), will loose all Pow, but may regain normally. A magician in contact
with black Iron cannot cast any spells. Any spells being cast are lost.

Creature with magical abilities: e.g. Dragons. Will be unable to use magic,
but will not be otherwise damaged.

Enchanted creatures: Skeletons, Golems, etc - will be DESTROYED if touched
by enough black iron. Note, the creature, not its weapons must be touched.

Summoned creatures: Demons etc: If an amount of black iron smaller than the
demon's Pow is used, the iron just explodes. The black iron must "hit" the
demon - exceed weapon parry and armor (if armor is not part of the demon).
Note that demon Pow must be decided by the GM for each demon type. If a
large enough piece of black iron is used, roll d6 to determine effect on the
following table:

.Black Iron and Summoned Creatures
[options="header"]
|====
| Roll   | Effect
| 1      | Demon binding spell is broken - demon is uncontrolled - probably kills caster
| 2      | Demon is destroyed
| 3      | Demon is returned to home plane
| 4      | Demon looses magical abilities
| 5      | Demon takes d6 of d6 of d6 damage (no armor or parry).
| 6      | No effect.
|====

==== Direct spells

If the target (or any target) of a direct spell is in the same hex as black
iron, the spell is absorbed.

==== Indirect spells

Black iron will stop a spell before it has converted to an active effect. It
will stop a fireball before it explodes, but not a lightning bolt. It will
stop ball lightning.

==== Area spells

If black iron is within the area of the spell, It will absorb the spell. If
a small amount of black iron is present, it will explode, and subtract that
much Pow from the spell.

==== Spell disruption

For spells where the area of effect is unclear - fast walk, teleport the
spell is cast at -5 if the spell in some way crosses an area of black iron.

Other properties of black iron: It cannot be melted, only carved. It cannot
be joined once broken. Under special rules it can be enchanted.

==== Black Iron Armor

Black iron plate will protect the wearer from ALL spells up to the
destruction limit of the black iron (about 30,000 Pow). Wearer is also
protected from fire and cold.

Black iron dust: the presence of black iron dust will make spell casting
difficult. The added difficulty is:

.Black Iron Effects

| Density         | Effect
| < 0.1 gm / M^2^ | Spells at -1
| > 0.3 gm / M^2^ | -2

| 3 gm / M^2^     | -4
| 10 gm           | -5

| 1 kg            | -9
|====


=== Artifacts

Special devices can be created to perform magical functions. Due to the wide
range of possible artifacts, only general guidelines can be made for their
creation.

Form: The form of the artifact must be consistent with its function. A
Hammer of Thunder is OK. A Propeller Beanie of Lightning Bolts is not.

Composition: Artifacts must be constructed of nearly unique materials. (no
mass production). Some examples are > 100ct gemstones, teeth of a greater
dragon, or large meteors,

to a standard counter. It is a continuing spell. It can only be used against
ranged spells (direct or indirect). The roll done at the same way as for a
counter except: The amount of deflect points must be declared before the
roll. The deflect is cast at mg+ plus 5. The number of hexes the spell can
be deflected is the number of pluses by which the deflect "wins". The
incoming spell must be deflected directly away from the deflecting mage. If
the attacking spell was not targeted at the deflecting mage, range cost , 10

=== Psionic abilities

If your Psi - General Plus is <= 0, you are considered to be Psi inactive,
and are not noticeable to other psionic creatures. If your Psi - General
Plus is > 0, then you are noticeable by other Psi creatures (using Psi -
detect).

Psi attacks are rolled with the attacker' skill at the Psi ability, against
the target's Psi - General or PSI Plus (defender's choice). Psi - Block and
other actions without a specific target are rolled against the universe.

Psi attacks may not be rolled at negative (base) pluses. A negative base
plus means you don't know that ability. Some abilities like Psi -
Communicate may be rolled if the base plus is not negative, even if the
final plus with modifiers is negative.

Psi attacks are performed every round. Any targets that failed a Psi defense
against the same attack in the previous round are at -5 defense. Any who
succeeded are at +5. After 10 rounds, Psi attacks are launched (and
resisted) every minute, after 10 minutes, every hour, after 10 hours, every
day.

Combining Psi attacks. Multiple people can combine Psi attacks. Each must
make a Psi General roll. If any fail, the attack fails for all. Pluses are
added as for normal skills.

Multiple Psi Actions: Are performed at -2 for each additional ability used.

==== Psi - Area block

This is used to block others from Psi attacks. The rules are similar to Psi
- Block (see below). It can be used to block any number of people within
line of sight. The roll for Psi - Block is made when the first attack
occurs. The block is rolled for every round in which an attack occurs. Psi
area block has a range of 100 hexes. It is cast at -1 for each factor of 2
in range. Psi - Block and Psi - Area Block cannot be used with any other
Psionic ability.

==== Psi - Area Hide

Really a lot more like area unobtrusiveness. Normal range is 100 hexes. Cast
at -1 for each factor of 2 in range. Add this plus (using plus addition
rules) to the unobtrusiveness plus of the group. The effect is not
invisibility, but rather "These are not the droids you are looking for".

==== Psi - Block

This is used to block the effects of Psi attacks. The amount by which the
Psi - Block roll succeeds each round is added to the defender's PSI Plus.
Psi - Block must be rolled separately in every round in which there is a Psi
attack. Psi - Block cannot be used with any other Psi ability.

==== Psi - Brain Scan

This is a very powerful psi ability. It allows you to read the target's
deepest thoughts. It requires a roll every 1 minute of scanning. Typically
it will take 100 minutes to scan all of the data in the target's mind.

==== Psi - Detect

This is the ability to detect psionic creatures at a distance. Creatures
must have PSI Plus > 0 in order to be detectable. A flat roll is required to
detect a creature with 10 Psi at a range of 1 mile. Range is linear in the
PSI of the creature to be detected. Each +1 rolled, gives you X2 range.

[NOTE]
====
It's not clear what "10 Psi" means here. A PSI *stat* of 10, or a PSI *Plus*
of 10, or something else?
====

==== Psi - Displacement

This causes the target to think that you are in a slightly different
location. This will prevent missile attacks from hitting. It does not work
in hand to hand. Like other Psi abilities, it can be stopped by a Psi block.
It affects a single target.

==== Psi - general

This is your Plus at resisting psionic attacks.

==== Psi - Hide

Allows you to hide from searchers. It is treated like a stealth roll with
the same modifiers. Psi - Hide does not work against Psi - Detect. Use Psi -
Block instead. Adds to stealth plus using plus addition rules.

==== Psi - History

Gives the ability to tell something about a person's history by touch. After
a touch, the psionic will see important, but random scenes from the person's
past.

==== Psi - Language

This allows you to communicate with the target in their native language. The
language is normally forgotten after use.

==== Psi - Madness

A high level Psi ability. Causes everyone in the affected area to roll
against an attack at Psi - Madness plus or behave in an irrational fashion.
The choices (up to the attacker) are fear, aggressiveness, randomness, or
paralysis. The base area of effect is 100 hex radius, at a range of up to
200 hexes. The ability is used at -1 for each x2 in range or radius.

==== Psi - paralyze gaze

This is the ability to freeze an opponent in their tracks. Target must look
at your eyes or a -5 applies. Targets in combat will look at your eyes on a
7-.Range is line of sight to max of 10 hexes. Note, opponent can avoid eyes
but is -1 on all combat. Difficulty 5, EP 1000

==== Psi - Read Impression

The psionic equivalent of Read Body Language. Tends to be less abstract /
emotive: rather than "they're worried about something", would tend to return
"they're thinking they might be in trouble with their boss". Succeeds
proportional to amount over.

==== Psi - pain

Your basic psionic distraction attack. Opponent is -N on next rounds
offensive actions where N is the number your roll beat them this round.
Opponents in combat are already steeled for pain, and thus are only -N / 2
(round down). Range is line of sight to 10 hexes.

==== Psi - psi communication

Allows sending communication to a target that is expecting the communication
(-5 otherwise). Distance penalty: -log~2~(distance in miles). If the target
also has this skill, it may be added to the attempt.

==== Psi - send idea

An idea occurs to the target. Target is not compelled to act on the idea. -1
for each additional target of one "attack". Distance penalty:
-log~2~(distance in hexes). "These are not the droids you are looking for".

==== Psi - send image

Causes the target to think that they see something. Very powerful.

==== Psi - Telekinesis

A very advanced psi ability. Provides the ability to move objects by mind
alone. It provides motions and forces similar to those a human could
produce. If used for attack, it attacks at your Psi - General Plus for 2.0
base (for a dull object) and 5.0 base for weapons, or a parry of 15. If used
for lifting, the maximum amount that can be lifted is 30 pounds. These
numbers are multiplied by Psi / 10. Chaos Rules: For use in chaos. (Optional
Game Rules)


== Chaos Rules

Chaos rules are not available in most campaigns.

[NOTE]
====
Chaos is not even remotely fair. You can die (or worse) without warning.
====


[[chaons]]
=== Collecting Chaos Power (Chaons)

All sentients in Chaos have some amount of "Chaos Power" or _Chaons_. A
random trid will have one Chaon. When you kill something, you absorb half
(round down) of its Chaons except for those bound to "permanent" abilities.
The remaining Chaons are released. In order to collect the Pow, you must
meet the following requirements:

The target must be killed by a direct, immediate attack: sword, arrow,
spell, etc.

Chaons can only be absorbed from one source each round. Even if you asteroid
strike an entire city, you only get the Chaons from one (the most powerful)
entity. All other Chaons are lost.

People who do not already have chaos souls, will need the soul creation
spell to be cast before they can absorb Chaons. This depends on the
particular game, in some games anyone can collect Chaons, or there are Chaon
collection devices.

Permanent Pow may only be collected from a target by using the Chaos Binding
spell.

Chaons can also be collected from raw chaos with the Chaos Binding spell.
Raw chaos has a Pow density of 1 Chaon / 100hex.

Chaons can be collected from worshipers at a rate of 1 Chaon / 1000 man
years of worship. Worshipers must visit a temple at least one time each
year.

Chaons can be gained by sacrificing people (or similar sentients). 1 / 10
Chaon is gained for each person sacrificed.


=== Uses of Chaos Power

_Unbound_ Chaons are those collected by a player, but not yet bound into
chaos abilities (see below). Unbound Chaons may be moved to those abilities
(but not back), or used for Chaos Manipulation.

.Chaos Manipulation Pluses
[options="header"]
|====
| Chaons | Chaos Manipulation Plus
| 0      | Impossible
| 1      | +0
| 3      | +1
| 10     | +2
| 30     | +3

    but does not stop aging. Permanent.
  * Unaging: 5 Chaons. Stops aging at middle age.
  * Regeneration: Regenerate 1 HP / round for 100 Chaons. Regeneration goes
    as square root of Chaons. Permanent.
  * Strength: strength increases by (10 * sqrt(Chaons))%. This affects
    Damage, Defense, Parry, HP.
+
--
[NOTE]
====
Do not change your strength stat when gaining Chaos Strength. It is best to
compute the modifier and write to the modified stats in the weapons table.
====
--
  * Growth: 2X the effect of strength increase for the same cost. Height
    increase is proportional to strength increase. Irreversible. Can be
    combined with strength increase, but take square root of total Chaons in
    both to get Chaons required. Minimum 25 Chaons (100% strength and size
    increase). Permanent.
+
--
[NOTE]
====
Strength or Size abilities increase Grapple Plus by 1 for each multiple of
original strength.

  * Poison Immunity: 10 Chaons - immunity to all forms of poison
  * Flight: Minimum 100 Chaons, then hex / round for additional Chaons = 2 *
    sqrt(Chaons).

  * Insubstantiability: Allows the character to fade partially out of the
    real world, and into the spirit world. Maximum "percentage" a character
    can fade is equal to Chaons in the ability. Fading or reappearing

  ** All damage done, or received is multiplied by the % character is in the
     real world.
  ** Stealth is +1 for each 20% fade
  ** Sunlight does (1 point / round / fraction in the spirit world). For
     example, at 80% faded (20% in spirit world), damage will be 50 points /
     round from sunlight. Mithril flash powder does 3d6 * sunlight damage
     each round.
  * Magical Pow: Each Chaon increases your personal Pow by 1. Note: this is
    the only linear Chaon dependence.

=== Chaos Environment

Generic Chaos: Exists in the unstabilized regions of chaos. All magical
recovery occurs per round, not per minute. Spell miss by 1 or 2 is a fumble.
The terrain changes on a time scale of minutes. All distances are variable.

Each 12 hours roll for one of the following effects (flat roll):

[[chaos-environment-table]]

| Roll | Result
| 1    | Meteor Swarm: Each character has a 1% chance of taking a +0 / 200 attack
| 2    | Rain of Fire: d6 fire damage / minute until find shelter - resisted by volcano survival, fire shield, etc.
| 3    | Crevasse opens. All must roll an acrobatic roll at +8 (or be swallowed).

|====

If there are no waves, a roll for effects is required each day. If the roll
fails go to the chaos effects table.

Clear Area: An area which is temporarily or permanently clear of chaos.
Normal world rules apply here (except for the faster magic regeneration).
Even permanent clear areas can be destroyed by attacks from chaos creatures.

Chaos Wave: These occur in chaos areas. They are a more dense form of chaos
with stronger effects. A chaos wave may be generated by expending one Chaon
for each hex of range. The wave expands at 10 hexes / round from the point
of origin. When the wave passes, roll against the universe on the chaos
effects table. Physical objects affected at +0 / 10 when it passes.

Chaos Storm: A swirling area of chaos about 10 miles on a side. Every hour
(but at least once) everyone in the area must roll on the chaos effects
table at -3. Chaos storms can enter clear spots and travel for up for about
a day at 1 hex / round. Each hour a chaos storm has a 1% chance of spawning
a chaos tornado. Each hour there is a 10% chance of d6 level d6 chaos
creatures. A chaos storm can be created (but not controlled) by releasing
1000 Chaons. Each hour, roll physical damage +6 / 20 scale pluses +1 for
each x10 time.

Chaos Tornado: A small but very powerful chaos storm. It is 10 hexes in
radius, has a 1% chance per round of disappearing and can be detected d100
hexes (center of storm) away. It will move 3d6 hexes toward the largest
single source of Chaons in the area. A tornado is always accompanied by d6
level d6 chaos creatures. Each *round* in a chaos tornado, roll at -6
against the universe on the chaos effects table. A chaos tornado can be
created by releasing 1000 Chaons and making a successful chaos roll. A chaos
tornado can be controlled (moved) by a sucessful chaos roll at -6. If
contorlled, it moves at 20hex / round. On a failed roll, a storm is created.
Each round physical effect +8/50

Chaos Wall: A wall in chaos, generally stationary. Can be created by
expending 1 Chaon per hex length (roll required). Anything passing through
the wall will be affected: Roll at -6 against the universe on the chaos
effects table. When passed +8/30

==== Damage to physical objects

Any object in chaos is subject to damage. Damage is done per hex length of
the object, in the area of influence. For example a 100 hex long chaos ship,
hit by a tornado will take damage only for 20 hexes of length (the size of
the tornado). You need to keep track of the total damage to the object, and
the "area" damage. Use reasonable statistics for overlaps.

Each type of chaos effect (tornado, etc) has a chaos plus, and a base
damage. Staic Physical objects always have a DCV (for chaos purposes) of 0.
Moving objects (like ships, etc) will have their own plus, which is added to
the captain's plus.

==== Chaos Creatures

Chaos creatures are rolled randomly. Chaos creatures are immune to chaos
effects - or rather they are the result of the effects of chaos after long
periods of time. In general chaos creatures are motivated to kill to gain
more Chaons. However, those with INT above 10 can be bargained with. All
chaos creature can bring chaos behind them - they automatically destroy
clear zones when they enter them.

  * Intelligence d20, HP = d10 * d10 * d10, Def = d6 * d6 * d6, Move = d20.
    On a 18-20, d100 flying.
  * Combat plus = 3d6-6, Attack+ = Combat plus + d6-3 (Engage = (move +
    attack+)/2)
  * DCVs: Low = Combat Plus + d6 - 3, Med = Low + d6 - 1, High = Med + d6 -
    1
  * Attack damage = d6 * d6 * d6, Parry = Attack damage * d6 -3.

==== Manipulating Chaos

Chaons can be used to control chaos. When an attempt is made, roll with
chaos plus against the Difficulty (+3d6). Rules are similar to magic, with a
miss by 1 being a fumble. Failures release Chaons, and the GM will roll on
the <<uncontrolled-pow-effects,Uncontrolled Pow Effects>> table.

The listed Chaons must be expended to perform the listed action. Note that
if several entities try to control chaos in an area, you use the largest
rolled plus, but all other Chaons go uncontrolled (producing waves or
tornadoes). Note that chaos effects cannot be created inside a solid object.
Chaos effects created in a clear area will take 100 rounds to form, as the
chaos drops from the sky.

|====

*Contesting Chaos:* if several people are contesting control over an area of
chaos, take into account range effects, then each rolls with chaos plus. The
winner wins, the loser's Chaons are relased, producing storms, etc.

==== Chaos ship combat

Scale is 100 hexes, 10 rounds (so things move at 1/10 speed). Tornadoes
always move at 1 if uncontrolled, 2 if controlled (and last indefinitely on
combat scales)

Drafting: You can move at 2X normal speed, when following the route of
another another ship. The cleared routes last for the duration of the battle
(the map may get complex). When each ship moves, draw its move. The next
turn, any route can be followed at 2x speed (each hex counts as 1/2 movement
point.

Typical chaos warship stats: Speed 5, turn 1 / hex max. Accelerate /
decelerate 2 each round. Length = 100 hexes, DCV = 100 / hex, HP = 300 / hex
(50,000 total).


=== Spirits

In some games the souls of the dead remain active as spirits. A spirit with
no Chaons is a formless, invisible thing, unable to move. Spirits are not
effected by physical or energy attacks, but are effected by direct spells.
Spirits are dispelled by direct sunlight, or mithril flash poweder.

==== Gaining Chaos Pow

In addition to the standard methods, spirits gain 1/100 Chaons for each
normal human they kill

==== Uses of Chaos Pow

The following abilities are gained as Chaons are added

  * Form: 1 Chaon. Required for any other abilities
  * Movement: 1 Chaon: Can move 1 / hex. Movement rate increases as the
    square root of the number of Chaons.
  * Speech: 1 Chaon: ability to talk
  * Physical Form: 1 Chaon for each 1% of normal strength and coupling to
    physical attacks. Maximum coupling is 100%.
  * Magical Interaction: 100 Chaons gives normal magical interaction - both
    for offense and defense.

== Prices and Money System

  * 1 gold piece (GP) = 1 oz. = 100 silver pieces
  * 1 silver piece (SP) = 1 oz. = 100 copper pieces = $5 US (roughly)
  * 1 copper piece (CP) = 1 oz.

Effect of MON stat: For MON = 10, income is 100 SP / year, with savings of
100 SP. Double savings for each +1 in MON. Multiple typical income by
sqrt(2) for each +1 in MON. Note: all prices are retail. R indicates the
percentage of value when sold.

Item costs are retail. Wholesale prices are R * listed cost.

Costs are for long term labor are X4 for 1 hour - 1 day, X2 for 1 day to 1
week.

Hazardous duty (combat expected) is X10. Combat time is X100 (minimum 1
day).

Bargaining lists percentage.

== Miscellaneous Rules

=== Encumbrance

There is a limit to what can be carried by a character.

The following have special effects on encumbrance, in addition to their
weight.

.Encumbrance Effects on Movement
[options="header"]
|====
| Item                         | Acrobatics / Climbing / Stealth minus (in addition to encumbrance effects)
| Shield                       | -2
| Long bow (but not short bow) | -1
| Light leather                | -1
| Heavy Leather                | -1
| Chain                        | -2 (swimming impossible)
| Scale, plate                 | -3 (swimming impossible)
|====

[NOTE]
====
In practice, we rarely follow the rules below, although the effects on
movement (above) should be respected. The GM may inform a player that they
cannot carry multiple sets of Plate Armor or thousands of GP, but it's a
tedious hassle to track this all the time.

| Parka           |               | 20
|====


=== Construction and Fortifications

Type of wall and time to construct per foot of perimeter. It is assumed that
resources are available for wall. Note that normal labor rates are 25 SP /
year or 1cp (.01 SP) per hour. Material costs are for a typical area. Stone
and wood costs can easily vary a factor of 10 from the given numbers. In
areas where raw materials are free, assume 1/2 of the material cost is the
labor to "refine" the materials into useful forms. Defense / HP is per hex.

| Colossal stone fortification 100' tall (dark tower), 30' thick   | 20,000 hours      | 200 SP        | 600 / 1,000,000
|====

A castle wall, 200' on a side, with 15' stone fortifications, would cost
50Gold in materials and labor.

Defensive Wall gates: A typical gate for a defensive wall will have 1/4
the DEF and HP of the wall itself. A gate costs as much as 100' of wall.

Building construction costs per ft.^2^ of living area. These costs are
approximations. Occupancy is minimum ft.^2^ per person living in the
building. Building costs except where given are for wood construction. Stone
construction with wood floors is 50% more expensive. Stone construction with
stone floors is 2X the listed price. Additional cost is both on labor and on
materials.

|====

Crew: 400 pounds of cargo must be allocated for each person, plus 5 lb. /
day / person supplies.

Scale: Hexes are 100 ft, turns are 1 minute (for both to move). Speed 1 = 1
Knot.

==== Ship Stats:

Speed = number of "movement points" per round

Maneuverability, turns per hex. 1 - 1 hexside per hex. 2 = 2 hexsides per
hex.

Port cannon = number of cannons on the port side

Starboard cannon = number of cannons on the starboard side

Hull points = damage the hull can take

Rigging points = damage the rigging can take

Typical ship:

  * Hull points = 40
  * Rigging points = 18
  * Cannon = 10 Port, 10 Starbord
  * Calm wind movement: 0 points available
  * Light wind movement: 2 points available: cost = Inf, 2, 1, 1, turncost =
    1
  * Medium wind movement: 6 points available: cost = Inf, 3, 1, 1, turncost
    = 1
  * Strong wind movement: 12 points available: cost = Inf, 6, 3, 2 turncost
    = 2
  * Storm movement: 6 points available: cost = Inf, Inf, 2, 1 turncost = 3

==== Wind Direction and Strength

The wind direction is determined before combat begins. The wind may be
defined as normal, strong, or very strong. Unless there is a game reason it
should do otherwise, the wind has a 1/6 chance of changing direction by one
hex side each round (determined by die roll); if it changes, it has a 50-50
of each direction.

==== Ship Movement

At the start of its move, each ship has a number of available movement
points (determined from a chart of movement points vs speed for that ship).

Movement alternates between sides. Ships must use up all their movement
points in a round (though pointing into the wind to use them up is
acceptable). A ship cannot make more turns in a round than its
manueverability stat. Turning opposite directions in succession (i.e. in a
single hex) is not allowed.

Movement points can be permanently dropped (by removing sails) by deciding
to do so during the movement round before the one in which the movement is
reduced. Movement points can never be increased during a combat.

If the wind is strong, ships will drift one hex per round downwind. Storm,
two hexes per round (and higher drifts may be possible in more severe
weather conditions). These motions occur at the end of the ship's movement
phase.

==== Attacking Ships

*Damage Effects:*

Hull damage: The ship behaves normally down to zero hull points. At zero and
below, the ship is taking on water and will sink (probably in longer than
combat time) unless repaired, and cannot move (except to drift with the
wind). At negative hull points, the ship sinks at the start of its next
movement round.

Rigging damage: Movement points are proportional to the number of rigging
points. As you take rigging damage, your movement points decrease. Round
movement points up. At zero rigging points, the ship cannot move except to
drift with the wind.

Cannon damage: One point of damage to cannons takes out one cannon on the
side fired upon.

*Attacks:*

Ships fire at their gunners plus, with base damage = #cannons (on that side)
/ 10. Rigging shots are at -3. Damage is calculated in standard Hack and
Slay fashion. Cannon can only fire every 3 rounds: keep track as follows:

After finishing your move, put a horizontal line under the columns for Port
and Starboard guns. When you fire you cross the bottom-most line for that
side of the ship. There must be 2 un-crossed lines above the line you cross
in order to fire. You may fire at any point during your, or your opponent's
move.


== Silly Rules

These rules are for Vikings, Pirates, Barbarians, Bikers, and others whose
HP are more than twice their INT. Do not use in serious campaigns.

=== Recovery Rates (Silly)

HP always recover at C* / 10 (CON^2^ / 100) per hour.

=== Drinking Effects (Silly)

It is well known that a few stiff drinks will make you tougher. Just watch
any Viking, Pirate, or Biker flick. For each drink, make a Drinking roll at
minus the number of previous drinks. So, the third drink is at -2. If the
drinking roll fails, you take a -1 on all skills (including drinking). If
you fail a roll, roll again (for the same drink, but including the new
minus). If you fail, loose another plus, etc. When you are at -10 you pass
out. That's the bad news. The good news is that if you have N drinks, you
gain N^2^ HP.

=== Challenge by Head Butting (Silly)

The two challengers run head first at each other, and smash their heads
together. If both are left standing, they do it again.

Mechanics: Each secretly chooses a damage amount, which must be no greater
than their size (and should probably be quite a bit less). Each rolls 3d6,
adding the following pluses:

+2 for the combatant who applied the most points in damage

+CON plus for each combatant.

Each combatant then takes damage equal to: The sum of the damage points
applied by both combatants + the difference in the die rolls (added to one,
subtracted from the other).

=== Contest of Rock Carrying (Silly)

Each contestant picks up a 200 pound rock, and tries to carry it as far as
possible without dropping (it or themselves). Contestants are allowed to ram
each other.

Mechanics: This challenge is rolled at your working out plus. The roll is
made for each 10' the rock is carried. The roll is at -ft / 10 for feet
already traveled. If you wish to ram, make a roll at (size plus) + (agility
plus) against your opponent. If either looses by 5 or more, they drop their
rock. The ramming is done after the movement that round.

=== Trial by Axe (Silly)

Used to clear someone's reputation, usually after an accusation of
infidelity. The accused is placed in stocks, with their head exposed, and
their hair braided and nailed to the sides. The accuser, spouse, friend,
enemy, or random guy stands 5 hexes away and is given 3 axes. They then
throw the axes. If both braids are cut, the accused is cleared of all
charges. If the accused is hit - well then they were guilty. If the accuser
fails to cut the braids, they are taken away and executed (or forced to
undergo another trial).

Mechanics: The accused is DCV 0 (but gets a roll). Their hair is DCV -4, (-6
for long pigtails, -2 for short hair - if you are bald, well every see a
bald Viking?). The accuser throws the axes (they may drop pluses to drop
more pluses, and may aim). If they hit the hair, one braid is cut. If they
hit the accused, the accused takes normal damage (no armor or parry of
course).

=== Fireball (Obsolete)

Causes a ball of flame to explode at some range from the caster. This is an
indirect area-effect spell. A N die fireball, does N dice of damage in its
hex, one less die for each hex distance. Cost is 2 * N^2^ Pow. Range cost is
normal, 1 / hex. Difficulty 7, EP 1000


=== Darkness (Obsolete)

Darkness affects pluses to attack and defense. In also affects some other
physical skills including acrobatics, at the GM discretion. Note that your
DCV in combat is never worse than -4 absolute. You may add your "Combat
Darkness" skill to reduce the size of these negative pluses (but not
increase them above their daylight values). These pluses apply to offense
and defense. Note: flash powder is assumed only effective in darkness. Note,
remember minimum combat DCVs.

|====

New Flash powder Rules: Flash powder maybe used to blind opponents when
fighting in a dark area. The lightning bolt spell may be used as the
equivalent of flash powder. A minimum of 10 points must be put in the spell.

For normal opponents, flash powder causes an additional -2 to all combat,
for a number of rounds equal to 10 - range. The total effect is never worse
than -5 (pitch black combat). The effects of flash powder on normal
opponents are reduced by combat darkness.

For Darkness Creatures (Orcs, Goblins, etc), flash powder causes a minus to
all combat abilities equal to (10-range). This improves by 1 / round.

Special note on flash powder: Creatures who are expecting to be flashed may
close their eyes during the phase in which the flash occurs. During this
time they fight at "pitch dark" plus (fully defensive may be used). This
applies to people on both sides of the combat The defender may only use this
option if they are expecting the flash. One round must be spent in this
condition, before the attacker is flashed. Note that flash powder is only
effective in darkness.

==== Flash Powder (Obsolete)

A fine powder which burns brightly and quickly. Requires fine metal powders,
coal, sulfur. 1 unit will light up about a 10 hex radius with temporarily
blinding light. Requires at least 10 minutes to manufacture. See darkness
rules in combat section. Note that flash powder is flammable. Any accessible
flash powder units will explode at a percent chance = fire or lightning
damage done. Protected units have 1 / 10 chance of exploding, but take 10
rounds to ready. An exploded unit does 3d6 (add damages from all units, then
subtract armor). Difficulty 9. EP 100, Pow = 5 / unit. Materials cost is 10
SP / unit.


=== Special Angel and Demon Rules (Rarely Used)

These rules only apply in a limited set of games.

Angels (with 500pt souls) gain the following abilities: Gain 10x HP, 5X all
damages and defenses (even weapons - its magic). 5X Pow, 5x Pow regen rate.
Gain +20 defense. Gain +5 on all psi abilities. 20 pt / round regeneration

Characters with angelic / demonic powers have a certain number of power
points (independent of normal magical Pow) which can be distributed among
special abilities. Increase in power points happens very slowly, typically
just as a function of time. 1 Pow / year would be a typical increase rate.

Points may only be moved slowly from one ability to another. Movement rate
is 1 Pow / day moved. Abilities:

  * Size: For each Pow, the character gains the ability to grow 1/10 foot
    taller. Minimum 100 Pow increments. All damages, and defenses (including
    armor - this is a magical ability) grow by 2% / Pow. This is above and
    beyond all other effects. The character has the ability to change
    between normal size, and any size up to the maximum allowed by the
    allocated Pow, at will.
  * Flight: For 300 Pow, the character gains the ability to grow wings and
    fly (at will). Flight speed is 200 MPH, or about 5000 miles / day.
  * Beauty. For 100 Pow, the character gains unearthly beauty.
  * Weather control. For 100 Pow, the character gains the ability to control
    the local weather to some extend. Weather can be changed from calm to
    mild storm. This ability is not able to overcome other magical weather
    control.
  * Shape change - minor: Costs 100 Pow. Ability to change one's shape - but
    must remain vaguely humanoid - new appendages, and different appearance
    are OK.
  * Shape change - major: Costs 300 Pow. Ability to change one's shape to
    any form, Must conserve mass. Gain abilities of any animal of
    appropriate shape.
  * Shape change total: Cost 500 Pow. Ability to change shape to anything.
    Any size. Gain appropriate abilities.
  * Resistance to element: Cost 50 Pow. Reduce damage by factor of 10 from
    any elemental attack. Earth, Air, fire, water.
  * Invulnerability to Element: Cost 100 Pow, Completely immune to any damage
    from that element.


=== Mass combat rules (Rarely Used)

Movement sequence:

  * A move
  * Both attack/defend
  * Both morale check
  * Both move
  * Both attack/defend
  * Both morale check

1 unit = 10 men. 1 hex = 50', time = 20 seconds, stack limit = 10.

Movement rates are normal.

Combat occurs on hex sides, or in hexes for melee.

Each unit is described by a combat plus.

For each hex side roll combat. (attacker plus) + 3d6 compare with (defender
plus) + 3d6. +n destroys n-2 units (up to max in hex).

After combat, if a unit is destroyed, the attacker may move units 1 hex into
the empty hex (except across walls).

Missile attacks (after normal combat). Range is 3 hexes. Typically missile
units are -2 relative to normal units. If 2 missile units are attacking, +1,
4 units +2, etc.

=== Experimental Character Races

In addition to the races built into the Slay database, other humanoid player
races are defined below. After generating a character sheet in the normal
way, set the stat total to zero, which prevents state rebalancing. Then
apply the following modifications. You should save a copy of your character
file (+name.chr+) before doing this, in case of errors.

[NOTE]
====
It is the GM's choice whether these races are allowed. In recent campaigns,
the race system built into the skill database has been used in preference to
these hand-coded races.

==== Demon

Roll all stats on d20. On 20, re-roll and add. Player must agree to play
