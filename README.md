At present, the only content here is a conversion of the Hack and Slay
manual to asciidoc. It can be converted to HTML via 'make' or just

    asciidoctor -b html5 -o slay.html slay.adoc

Note: while running asciidoctor gives the best output, the current
slay.adoc on github can be viewed directly in a browser at
